# Ralph Baer's TV Game Version 2

Ralph Henry Baer, "the Father of Video Games", engineered the first home video game console, licensed by Magnavox as the Magnavox Odyssey.
Before the Odyssey came along, there were 3 prototypes, named TV Game 1, TV Game 2 and TV Game 3 "The Brown Box". The world famous Atari 
game _"Pong"_ is inspired by the _Table Tennis_ game available on the Brown Box and Odyssey.

This repository contains a true-to-original replica of the TV Game 2 video game console, drafted by Ralph in 1967. Thanks to the support from 
the Smithsonian Institute, we are able to obtain the original paper-based schematics, game overlays and an enclosure replica.

The finished unit will be on display in University of Pittsburgh's Vibrant Media Lab, headed by Dr. Zachary Horton.
